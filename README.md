## 💡 The Problem

You're a competitive programmer. You know that feeling:

> _"Wait, there was a Codeforces round today?!"_

You set calendar reminders. You forget to check them. You rely on willpower. You oversleep. You miss Div. 2 rounds, weekly LeetCode contests, and CodeChef starters — **over and over again.**

**CodeBuzzer exists to make that impossible.**

---

## 🚀 Features

### 🔔 Aggressive, Multi-Stage Alarm System

Not just one gentle notification. CodeBuzzer hits you with a **cascade of escalating reminders**:

| Time Before Contest | Alert Type                                           |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| ⏳ 30 minutes       | Push notification                                    |
| ⏳ 10 minutes       | Push notification                                    |
| 🔊 5 minutes        | **Full-screen ringing alarm** (loud, with vibration) |
| 🟢 Contest start    | Push notification                                    |

The full-screen alarm rings **even when your phone is locked or the app is closed.** It's like a phone call you can't ignore.

### 📅 Smart Contest Calendar

- Horizontal scrollable calendar with contest indicators on each day
- Smart date-snapping — auto-jumps to the next contest day on launch
- Filter by platform to see only contests you care about
- Platform-specific timeline mode for focused browsing

### 🌐 Multi-Platform Support

| Platform       | Source                                 | Status              |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| **Codeforces** | Live API (`codeforces.com/api`)        | ✅ Real-time        |
| **LeetCode**   | Hardcoded schedule (Weekly + Biweekly) | ✅ Always available |
| **CodeChef**   | Hardcoded schedule (Weekly)            | ✅ Always available |
| **AtCoder**    | —                                      | 🔜 Coming soon      |

> LeetCode and CodeChef contests follow fixed schedules, so they're generated locally — **no API dependency, no failures, works offline.**

### 🔄 Background Sync (48h Auto-Refresh)

CodeBuzzer uses Android's **WorkManager** to silently sync contests every 48 hours in the background. Even if you don't open the app for a month, your alarms will keep updating themselves.

### 📱 Swipe-to-Action Alarm Screen

When the alarm rings, you get a beautiful full-screen experience:

- **Swipe left** → Dismiss
- **Swipe right** → Snooze (5 min)
- Or just **tap** the labels directly

No accidental dismissals. Inspired by the phone call UX.

### ⏰ Custom Manual Reminders

Have a mock contest? A study session? An interview?

- Tap **"Add Alarm"** on any date to create your own custom reminder
- Set a title, description, and exact time
- Full alarm support — just like contest reminders

### 🎨 Premium Dark UI

- Glassmorphism design with frosted blur effects
- Animated nebula landing screen with dancing platform logos
- Smooth micro-animations and transitions
- Green accent color palette (`#1CD065`)
- Google Sans typography throughout

### ⚙️ Full Customization

- **Toggle platforms** on/off independently
- **Custom alarm sounds** — pick any audio file from your phone
- **Permission manager** — one-tap setup for exact alarms, notifications & overlays
- Battery optimization tips built-in
